			<p>1. In a pan over a low heat, add a splash of water and two-thirds of the basil leaves and heat until wilted. Take it off the hob, leave to cool, then carefully squeeze out the excess water.</p>

			<p>2. Pop the leaves in a blender with 75g of the ricotta and blitz to a purée. Transfer it to a large bowl along with the remaining ricotta, the parmesan and eggs, and whisk vigorously, until light and airy.</p>

			<p>3. Using a large metal spoon, fold the flour into the ricotta mixture, adding a little more if it's too sticky – it needs to be soft and moist. </p>
